The Vulerability Assessment folder provides utilities that extend on OSSIM's inbuilt scanning. 

By default it is not possible to use the awesome risk analysis metrics (Priority * Reliability * Asset Value / 25 = Risk) in to create alarms within Alienvault. 

By installing the openvas plugin (copy to /etc/ossim/agent/plugins/openvas.cfg) and enabling this plugin you will be able to convert events from an OpenVAS vulerability assessment into actionable tickets. 

Note that if using this plugin you will want to disable the setting "Vulnerability Ticket Threshold" in the main Alienvault configuration screen.
