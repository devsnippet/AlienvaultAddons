The AlienvaultAddons project is a collection of utilities designed to extend the core functionality of Alienvault's OSSIM product. 

*Vulnerability Assessment*: By default OSSIM (at least as of 4.x) doesn't provide a way to readily perform risk analysis based on vulnerabilities. This module provides a fix. 

*OSSEC Local Rules*: If you use OSSEC on Windows by default there is a large amount of background noise generated. These rules provide some much needed cleanup.
